### Fall 2020

While data and artificial intelligence are driving many changes to our economic, social, political, financial, and legal systems, we know surprisingly little about their foundations and governing dynamics. While the recombination and integration of diverse data creates vast new value, we currently have neither theory for how data can be combined nor industrial policy for how to protect against the personal exposures and abuses that grow in proportion. Many of these issues call for treating data as a first-class citizen and thinking of it as an asset. What is the value of data? and how do we measure it? This course explores these questions from the perspective of different communities including computer scientists, economists, social scientists, among others. Students who complete the course will have defined and explored a topic related to 'the value of data' in depth, including the motivation, execution, rigorous evaluation, and exposition of the work. Lectures will seek active discussion among peers and will be complemented with weekly readings.

The course can be taken pass-fail or for a letter grade, but does not count for an elective.  For a letter grade, you need to complete an individual, quarter-long, data science oriented project. You also need to attend classes, participate in discussions, and scribe for two classes. For pass-fail, you do not need to complete the individual project but all other requirements apply.
