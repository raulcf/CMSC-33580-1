### Fall 2022

While data and artificial intelligence are driving many changes to our economic, social, political, financial, and legal systems, we know little about their foundations and governing dynamics. While the recombination and integration of diverse data creates vast new value, we currently have neither theory for how data can be combined nor an industrial policy for how to protect against the personal exposures and abuses that grow in proportion. 
Many of these issues call for treating data as a first-class citizen and thinking of it as an asset. What is the value of data? and how do we measure it? This course explores these questions from a multidisciplinary perspective that includes computer science, economy, social science, among others. 
The sessions are organized around broad themes related to the value of data. Then, we will transition to discussing data markets. In this class we define data market as an environment where agents exchange data. That agents are part of the definition is crucial and gives us a hint about the social aspects that surround data. We will reflect on how badly designed data markets underperform and sometimes cause harm. And we will ask how we can design well-functioning data markets to extract the value of data. 

A typical session will consist of a short introduction by the instructor, followed by a paper discussion (students are expected to read the assigned papers ahead of the class), and finishing with a discussion about individual projects.

The course can be taken pass-fail or for a letter grade (i.e., as an approved elective). For a letter grade, you need to complete an individual, quarter-long project. You also need to attend classes, participate in discussions and activities. For pass-fail, you do not need to complete the individual project but all other requirements apply.

#### Learning Objectives

In addition to learning about a varied set of topics related to data science, management, and data economics, the following are the specific learning objectives of this class:

- To become comfortable discussing papers written in different styles by researchers in diverse research communities.

- To become comfortable scrutinizing diverse research methodologies including systems, analytical approaches, and empirical ones.

- To learn how to distill the essence of a paper and ask research questions.

- To learn how to conduct a literature review.

- To practice your spoken and written communication skills when conveying advance material to a technical audience.


### Course Information

**Instructor:** [Raul Castro Fernandez](https://raulcastrofernandez.com) (raulcf@uchicago.edu)

**Lectures:** Friday 9:30am–12:20am (Central Time)

**Prerequisites:** Permission from the instructor.

**Coursework:** The bulk of the grade for this class corresponds to an individual, quarter-long project. See grading below.

**Canvas Site:** Go [here](https://canvas.uchicago.edu/courses/45292). You will be using Canvas mainly to submit your reading responses (see Grading below for more details). Otherwise, the bulk of the content is in this page, including the schedule, which links to the readings for each week.

**Room:** JCL 011

### Grading

- **Course Project (80%).** A quarter-long project where you get to explore, study, and develop ideas in an area related to the value of data and data markets. The deliverables are: i) an 8-10 page double-column report (ACM format); ii) a presentation of the main ideas to the class. The project will be evaluated based on the quality of the content, the thoroughness of the research, as well as the presentation quality. See below for more details.
- **Reading Responses (10%).** Ahead of each class, submit your reading responses via Canvas.
- **Class Participation (10%).** Read the reading assignments and participate in discussions during class.

#### Project Rubric

The project will be evaluated as follows:

- **Project Proposal (10%).** In 300 words, explain the motivation for the project, describe the approach you plan to follow to complete the project, the expected outcomes, and provide a rubric to evaluate the project.
- **Project Report (10%)** In 300 words, explain the progress made so far. This is your opportunity to update your proposal. Clearly and briefly justify any changes you make.
- **Presentation (25%)** Present your project to the class.
- **Final Report (35%)** An 8-10 page double-column report (ACM format).

Ahead of the project proposal, you must agree on a topic with the instructor. The instructor will provide a set of see ideas during the first lecture for you to consider and use as inspiration. You can work on a project related to your research if it is relevant to the class and is previously agreed with the instructor. 

### Schedule

The schedule [is available here](schedule.md). Check it out frequently as the readings for each week will be included here.

The schedule combines lectures with discussion-based sessions led by the instructor and hands-on activities. Most lectures and discussion sessions require working on some readings before class. We will cover topics that include: data science, the 4th paradigm of science, data lifecycles, privacy, FAIR principles, the value of data from a macro perspective, the value of data from within an organization, sharing platforms, data markets, personal data markets, privacy, ethics, ownership of data, data unions cooperatives, data dividends, as well as other markets of information and more.

### UChicago Health Pact

All students on campus are required to adhere to the guidelines in the UChicago Health
Pact in order to promote a safe environment in the classroom.

- Secure face coverings must be worn appropriately at all times at all times while in
University buildings
