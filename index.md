### Fall 2020

While data and artificial intelligence are driving many changes to our economic, social, political, financial, and legal systems, we know surprisingly little about their foundations and governing dynamics. While the recombination and integration of diverse data creates vast new value, we currently have neither theory for how data can be combined nor an industrial policy for how to protect against the personal exposures and abuses that grow in proportion. Many of these issues call for treating data as a first-class citizen and thinking of it as an asset. What is the value of data? and how do we measure it? This course explores these questions from the perspective of different communities including computer scientists, economists, social scientists, among others. Students who complete the course will have defined and explored a topic related to 'the value of data' in-depth, including the motivation, execution, rigorous evaluation, and exposition of the work. Lectures will seek active discussion among peers and will be complemented with weekly readings.

The course can be taken pass-fail or for a letter grade but does not count for an elective. For a letter grade, you need to complete an individual, quarter-long, data science oriented project. You also need to attend classes, participate in discussions, and scribe for two classes. For pass-fail, you do not need to complete the individual project but all other requirements apply.

### Grading

- **Course Project (80%).** Quarter-long project based on seed ideas or proposed by the student and agreed upon during the first week.
- **Class Participation (10%).** Read the reading assignments and participate in discussions during class, office hours, and online.
- **Class Scribing (10%).** Students are responsible for scribing 2 classes. Good scribing should be organized, should capture the content and discussions during the class, and should be useful to other students.

### Schedule

The specific dates and sessions will be available soon.

The schedule combines lectures with discussion-based sessions led by the instructor as well as *workshops*, where we all work together on an open question. Most lectures and discussion sessions require working on some readings before class. We will cover topics that include: data science, the 4th paradigm of science, data lifecycles, privacy, FAIR principles, the value of data from a macro perspective, the value of data from within an organization, sharing platforms, auction-based markets and other mechanism design topics, personal data markets, privacy, ethics, ownership of data, data unions cooperatives, data dividends, as well as other markets of information.
