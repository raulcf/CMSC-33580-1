### Spring 2024

This class is offered as a seminar in Spring'24. If you are planning to take it to satisfy requirements for a degree, double-check that that is possible. The seminar is focused on answering one question: "what is the value of data?". Throughout a mix of lectures and paper discussions, we will explore the many dimensions of this question. This seminar explores this question from a multidisciplinary perspective that includes computer science, economics, social science, among others.

A typical session will consist of a short introduction by the instructor, followed by a paper discussion (students are expected to read the assigned papers ahead of the class).

#### Learning Objectives

In addition to learning about a varied set of topics related to data science, management, and data economics, the following are the specific learning objectives of this class:

- To become comfortable discussing papers written in different styles by researchers in diverse research communities.

- To become comfortable scrutinizing diverse research methodologies, including systems, analytical approaches, and empirical ones.

- To learn how to distill the essence of a paper and ask research questions.

- To practice your spoken and written communication skills when conveying advanced material to a technical audience.
